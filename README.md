#electron-vibrancy

This module is intended to give an [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) BrowserWindow blur on its behind. This isnt supported on Electron and this module uses native API calls to achieve the effect.

# Running

Since this is a native addon, you will need your platforms build tools. Visual Studio,XCode etc.
```
npm install
npm test
```

```npm install``` will compile the addon for Electron ```1.4.2```, if you are using different version, change the electron version at ```package.json``` scripts.


# Things to note
- Window must be transparent.
- You can only blur the whole window, therefore only blurring behind a single element isnt possible.
- If your window has a frame, the frame will also be blurred.
- Requires Yosemite on macOS.
- On Windows 8.x, this wont work because Microsoft completely removed Aero Glass feature. It is still possible though but it is not something that an end user should do.
See Platforms section for more info.
- It is known that **Dev Tools attached to the window** *sometimes* breaks transparency, it is not related to this module.

# API
There is a single method that toggles the vibrancy.

### `SetVibrancy(state, windowBuffer, options)`

* `state` Boolean
* `windowBuffer` Buffer
* `options` Object

Enables or disables vibrancy for the window. Options are platform specific and optional.

#### Options for macOS
* `Material` Integer - The Material for NSVisualEffectMaterial.**0**: AppearanceBased,**1**: Light,**2**: Dark,**3**: Titlebar,**4**: Selection.

See [here](https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nsvisualeffectmaterial?language=objc) for more info.


```
electronVibrancy.SetVibrancy(true,browserWindowInstance.getNativeWindowHandle(), { Material: 0 });
```

## How to use

```
// Require the module
var electronVibrancy = require('..');
electronVibrancy.SetVibrancy(true,browserWindowInstance.getNativeWindowHandle());


// Preferred Usage

// mainWindow with show: false
mainWindow.on('ready-to-show',function() {
  var electronVibrancy = require('..');
  electronVibrancy.SetVibrancy(true,mainWindow.getNativeWindowHandle());
  mainWindow.show();
})

```


## Platform notices

### Windows
On **Windows 10** the addon uses ```SetWindowCompositionAttribute``` on Windows 10, which is an undocumented API, which means it can be changed by Microsoft any time and break the functionality.
On **Windows 8.x**, Aero Glass or any other blurring feature is removed by Microsoft.But you can use [Aero Glass](http://www.glass8.eu/) to enable it again. If you install it, the addon calls
`DwmEnableBlurBehindWindow` and the window will blend with whats behind.
